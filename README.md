# Tree-sitter parser for yscript

## Building

To generate Wasm that will work with `web-tree-sitter`, **you must use emscripten <= 2.0.17** (see [comment](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/1652#issuecomment-1040228808)). Use [emsdk](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) to switch versions easily.
